# Potentiometer board

The potentiometer board fits the same form factor and 20x20mm mounting hole pattern 
as the popular dual encoder board. 

This board features a soldering footprint for an Alps RK09 style potentiometer (the one that looks similar
to common EC11-style rotary encoders) and a three pin JST XH connector for the wires.

This repository contains the KiCad project files and also a gerber zip that can be used to manufacture the board.
But if you are interested in this board, you can also find it in the 
[MobiFlight Community Shop](https://shop.mobiflight.com/product/potentiometer-bundle) bundled with a resin printed
knob set.
